We propose the development of a Parking Management & Reservation System for Rutgers University, designed to offer a seamless and user-centric parking experience. This comprehensive system will empower users to access vital information about parking lots, pricing plans, and amenities, facilitating convenient selection and reservation of parking spaces. Users will benefit from a straightforward registration process, account management tools, and secure payment options, with premium subscribers enjoying reservation perks. Parking managers will have access to a dashboard for efficient oversight, layout customization, and dynamic pricing capabilities. Additionally, the system provides routing instructions and license plate scanning for elevator terminal reservations, enhancing overall efficiency and satisfaction. This project aims to improve parking management at Rutgers University, ensuring a streamlined and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders.

The web site will be developed using Javascript, HTML, CSS. We would be having a database to store the collections and communicate using REST APIâ€™s.
